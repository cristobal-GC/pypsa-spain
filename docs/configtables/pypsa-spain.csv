,Unit,Values,Description
q2q_transform,,,
-- enable,bool,"{true, false}","Q2Q transforms improve the estimation of the renewable profiles based on historical data. A repository and additional explanation an analyses can be found at the `Q2Q_repository <https://github.com/cristobal-GC/Q2Q_repository>`_"
-- {carrier},-,str,Path of the file with the q2q transform for this carrier. See ``data_ES/q2q/``.
electricity_demand,,,
-- enable,bool,"{true, false}","Allows to customise the electricity demand."
-- annual_value, TWh,int/float,"Annual demand."
-- profiles,-,str,Path of the file with the electricity demand profiles. See ``data_ES/electricity_demand/``.
-- percentages,-,str,Path of the file with the electricity demand percentages. See ``data_ES/electricity_demand/``.
interconnections,,,
-- enable,bool,"{true, false}","Allows to include user-defined interconnections with neighbouring countries."
-- nc_ES_file,-,str,Path of the file with the configuration of the neighbouring countries.
-- ic_ES_file,-,str,Path of the file with the configuration of the interconnections.
update_elec_capacities,,,
-- enable,bool,"{true, false}","Allows to impose the installed capacity at NUTS-2 level."
-- carriers_to_update,,,
costs_update,,,
-- enable,bool,"{true, false}","Allows to introduce modifications in the cost file."
-- costs_update_file,,,
ISA_class,,,
-- enable,bool,"{true, false}","Allows to use the Spanish 'Indice de Sostenibilidad Ambiental' for solar and onwind land elegibility."
ISA_{carrier},,,
-- grid_codes,-,"{4,3,2,1,0}","Level 0 means highest ambiental sensitivity, level 4 means lowest. For example, to set sensitivity threshold 2, select {4, 3, 2}"
H2_valley_demands,,,
-- enable,bool,"{true, false}","Allows to include discrete H2 demands."
-- file,-,str,"Path of the file with the definition of the discrete H2 demands."
regional_network_focus,,,
-- enable,bool,"{true, false}","Allows to cluster the network with more focus on a specific region NUTS-2 or NUTS-3. Clustering mode should be set to `busmap`, and cluster algorithm to `k-means`."
-- region_NUTS,-,str,"NUTS-2 or NUTS-3 code of the region."
-- k_focus,-,int/float,"Intensity of the weighting applied to the focus region. Higher values increase the weights of its buses, leading the clustering algorithm to allocate more clusters there. Very large values may increase runtime."
